Requirements:

  - No Python dependencies
  - Small external dependency on pbcopy. Remove the pipe to tee (and pbcopy)
    in main.sh if you don't have this. All it does is copy stdout to the
    clipboard.
  - Create a secrets.py file containing your lichess username(s) as an array
    called MY_USERNAMES

Usage:

  $ ./main.sh https://lichess.org/wuksmccH
