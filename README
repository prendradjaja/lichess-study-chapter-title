Requirements:

  - No dependencies
  - Create a secrets.py file containing your lichess username(s) as an array
    called MY_USERNAMES
  - Small dependency on pbcopy. Remove the tee (and pbcopy) in main.sh if you
    don't have this. All it does is copy stdout to the clipboard.

Usage:

  $ ./main.sh https://lichess.org/wuksmccH
